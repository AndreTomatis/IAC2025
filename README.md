With the advancement in miniaturization of space platforms, the access to more powerful and affordable hardware, companies and univerisites have seen in cubesats and more broadly smallsat an opportunity in research and investment.This exponentially increased the quantity of satellites in Low Earth Orbit placing the demand for more and more ground stations.\\
On this matter, the Cubesat \acs{PoliTO} Team, a university student team at the Polytechnic University of Turin, addressed the demand for a local ground station to serve the university's satellites with the \textbf{Cubesat Control Centre}, \textbf{\acs{C3}} for short.\\
The \textbf{CubeSat PoliTO Team} boasts decades of expertise in the design, construction, and operation of CubeSats. It first launched \textbf{e-st@r-I} in 2012 during the Vega maiden launch, then \textbf{e-st@r-II} in 2016, as well as collaboration with local and international student teams. During these missions, ground operations were performed using ground stations loaned by local amateur radio associations. Although the goal of communicating with our satellites was thus fulfilled, problems and delays caused by the difficult integration and logistics began to be felt and the necessity of a local independent ground station raised.\\
This paper first discusses about the C3 itself and the future satellite, \textbf{ELECTRA}, that will be served by \acs{C3}. It follows a discussion about the scheduler and how it has been implemented on the already developed and functional system. Data recovery efforts using machine learning algorithms are addressed afterwards. Finally, the paper discusses the latest tests that have been carried out and the future full functional test that will be performed as soon as the ground station is assembled.
This repo contains the code for the Data Recovery algorithm presented in the paper .
